Laying out the course syllabus or key objectives for a course focused on web scraping using R.

1. The web is a system of internet servers that support specially formatted documents, typically written in HTML. Understanding how the web works, including how information is sent and received, is crucial to web scraping.

2. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. Since web pages are written in HTML, it's necessary to understand this language to extract information from them.

3. XML (eXtensible Markup Language) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) are commonly used formats for data interchange on the web. They're both used to encode data in a format that can be read by both humans and machines.

4. Web Scraping is a method used to extract large amounts of data from websites where data is unstructured. It involves making HTTP requests to the specific URLs of the websites, inspecting the page structure, and then parsing the HTML to extract the data.

5. R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation. It has numerous packages, like rvest and xml2, which make it easier to scrape information from the web.
